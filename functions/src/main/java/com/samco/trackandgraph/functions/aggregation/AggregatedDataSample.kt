 * This class represents the initial points clustered into the parent-attribute of the AggregatedDataPoints.
 * To obtain usable values, one of the follow-up functions like sum, average, or max need to be called.
 * Note that some follow-up functions drop data-points without parents. This is supposed to be intuitive :)
